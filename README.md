>## Description
This is a project that generates an xkcd based style password based on user input options.The user is allowed to select a password from 1-5 words via a dropdown menu which prevents any invalid input.  The user can the select a checkbox option for incorporating a special character and/or a number. 

## Demo Information
    
## Details
   This version uses a simple 15 word array which given enough time I would have liked to have converted an online English work text file to a PHP word array file to use.  In addition, the random number function of the code selects only numbers 0-9.  This function is easily modified by changing the bounds to the rand function call.  Finally, the code uses only the 10 numeric special character set.  I decided to modulate the code as much as possible by providing an index.php for presentation, logic.php that performs all the generation functions, an external CSS for visual presentation, and a header and footer PHP for specific content.
